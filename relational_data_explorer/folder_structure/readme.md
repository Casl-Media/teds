<p>to create a tree similar to the link above with the local directory of your choice:</p>
<p>change the directory in the walk_dir variable in tree.py. See the <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.join">os.path.join docs</a> for usage. Once you run tree.py (tested with python 2.7) it will re-write sample_data.js, you can then open structure_visual.html in a modern browser and the tree should be rendered using D3.js. Note: some browsers might not like loading local files (or D3).</p>
